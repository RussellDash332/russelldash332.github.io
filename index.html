						So you have found me... Messing with GitHub Pages, trying new things. Yes, trying new things is what I have been doing almost everytime, especially during holidays. As a result, I learn many new things every single day.
					-->
                    <p>I'm currently a final year undergraduate studying Data Science and Analytics in the National University of Singapore (<a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">NUS</a>). I also took a minor in Computer Science, which I believe will be a good supplement for
                        my data science journey. I'm currently focusing on machine learning and deep learning and hoping for the best to learn many insights from them!</p>
                    <p>I do create Telegram bots when I'm bored, probably because I use Telegram often so I can interact with these bots easily. It also helps me on my teaching in NUS.
                        You can have a look at <a href="https://github.com/RussellDash332/">my GitHub profile</a> for some of the bots' codes!</p>

                                <p>I got the chance to become one of the panelists in PINUS Open Day 2021, an event held by the Indonesian NUS Students Associate, to reach out to current Indonesian students
                                    aiming for admission opportunities in NUS. During the event, I talked about my admission journey and university life as a data science undergraduate student.</p>

                                <p>I did a sharing about NUS in general during the Wardaya Education Expo held some time ago. It was attended by around 1200 participants around Indonesia.
                                    During the session I also shared my tips on having a pleasant university life, especially in NUS.
